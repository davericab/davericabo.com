<p> When the days are cold <br>
 And the cards all fold<br>
 And the saints we see<br>
 Are all made of gold<br>
 When your dreams all fail<br>
 And the ones we hail<br>
 Are the worst of all<br>
 And the blood's run stale<br></p>
 <p>I wanna hide the truth<br>
 I wanna shelter you<br>
But with the beast inside<br>
There's nowhere we can hide<br>
No matter what we breed<br>
We still are made of greed<br>
This is my kingdom come<br>
This is my kingdom come<br></p>
<p>When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
Don't get too close<br>
It's dark inside<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
It's where my demons hide<br></p>
<p>At the curtain's call<br>
It's the last of all<br>
When the lights fade out<br>
All the sinners crawl<br>
So they dug your grave<br>
And the masquerade<br>
Will come calling out<br>
At the mess you've made<br></p>
<p>Don't wanna let you down<br>
But I am hell-bound<br>
Oh, this is all for you<br>
Don't wanna hide the truth<br>
No matter what we breed<br>
We still are made of greed<br>
This is my kingdom come<br>
This is my kingdom come<br></p>
<p>When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
Don't get too close<br>
It's dark inside<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
It's where my demons hide<br></p>
<p>They say it's what you make<br>
I say it's up to fate<br>
It's woven in my soul<br>
I need to let you go<br>
Your eyes, they shine so bright<br>
I wanna save that light<br>
I can't escape this now<br>
Unless you show me how<br></P
<p>When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
Don't get too close<br>
It's dark inside<br>
It's where my demons hide<br>
It's where my demons hide<br></p>

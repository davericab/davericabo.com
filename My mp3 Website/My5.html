<p>You call me out upon the waters<br>
The great unknown<br>
Where feet may fail<br>
And there I find You in the mystery<br>
In oceans deep<br>
My faith will stand<br></p>
<p>And I will call upon Your name<br>
And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
For I am Yours<br>
You are mine<br></p>
<p>Your grace abounds in deepest waters<br>
Your sovereign hand<br>
Will be my guide<br>
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me<br>
You've never failed<br>
And You won't start now<br></p>
<p>So I will call upon Your name<br>
And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
When oceans rise<br>
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
For I am Yours<br>
And You are mine (You are mine)<br></p>
<p>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br></p>
<p>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br></p>
<p>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br></p>
<p>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
And take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br></p>
<p>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
And take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br></p>
<p>Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br></p>
<p>Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah<br></p>
<p>Oh, Jesus, You're my God<br></p>
<p>I will call upon Your name<br>
Keep my eyes above the waves<br>
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
I am Yours<br>
And You are mine<br></p>

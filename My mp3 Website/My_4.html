<p>I know I can't take one more step towards you<br>
'Cause all that's waiting is regret<br>
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore<br>
You lost the love I loved the most<br></p>
<p>I learned to live half alive<br>
Now you want me one more time<br></p>
<p>Who do you think you are?<br>
Runnin' 'round leaving scars<br>
Collecting your jar of hearts<br>
Tearing love apart<br></p>
<p>You're gonna catch a cold<br>
From the ice inside your soul<br>
So don't come back for me<br>
Who do you think you are?<br></p>
<p>I hear you're asking all around<br>
If I am anywhere to be found<br>
But I have grown too strong<br>
To ever fall back in your arms<br></p>
<p>I've learned to live half alive<br>
Now you want me one more time<br></p>
<p>Who do you think you are?<br>
Runnin' 'round leaving scars<br>
Collecting your jar of hearts<br>
Tearing love apart<br></p>
<p>You're gonna catch a cold<br>
From the ice inside your soul<br>
So don't come back for me<br>
Who do you think you are?<br></p>
<p>It took so long just to feel alright<br>
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes<br>
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed<br>
'Cause you broke all your promises<br>
And now you're back<br>
You don't get to get me back<br></p>
<p>Who do you think you are?<br>
Runnin' 'round leaving scars<br>
Collecting your jar of hearts<br>
Tearing love apart<br></p>
<p>You're gonna catch a cold<br>
From the ice inside your soul<br>
So don't come back for me<br>
Don't come back at all<br></p>
<p>Who do you think you are?<br>
Runnin' 'round leaving scars<br>
Collecting your jar of hearts<br>
Tearing love apart<br></p>
<p>You're gonna catch a cold<br>
From the ice inside your soul<br>
Don't come back for me<br>
Don't come back at all<br></p>
<p>Who do you think you are?<br>
Who do you think you are?<br>
Who do you think you are?<br></p>
